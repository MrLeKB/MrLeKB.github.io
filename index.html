									<h2>About Me</h2>
									<p>I am a Chinese national and have been living in Singapore for over 16 years. Recently, I graduated from Singapore Management University with a degree in information systems and am currently seeking my first full-time job in Singapore. As a foreigner, I believe it may be more challenging for me in my job search. To increase my chances, I created this website.</p>
									<p>During my studies in Human Resource at Singapore Polytechnic, I discovered my passion for data analytics and subsequently switched to Information Systems in university to pursue this interest. I thoroughly enjoy all aspects of it and have gained experience through various internships and projects. What truly motivates me is the prospect of uncovering hidden insights and to know the ‘truth’ that is closest to reality, and being able to substantiate claims with concrete evidence that I have discovered myself. </p>
