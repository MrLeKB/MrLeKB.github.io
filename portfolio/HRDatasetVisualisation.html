									<h2>HR Data Visualisation</h2>
									<p>The visualisation is built upon the 
										<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set?datasetId=1632&sortBy=voteCount&sort=published">Resources Data Set</a>
										<br>
										The visualisation is embeded below, alternatively it can be access on <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/HRDatasetVisualisation/ManagerialEffectonPerformance?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link">Tableau Public</a>
									</p>									
								</header>
								<p>The visualization utilizes the HR dataset to answer several questions, such as whether there is a relationship between managers and the performance of their subordinates, 
									areas where pay may not be equitable, and reasons for terminations. The analysis can be found below. 
									Please feel free to explore the parameters within the visualization as there may be additional insights that were not included in the analysis.</p>

										<h3>Managerial Effect on Performance</h3>
									</header>
									<p>A group of 8 managers, each with between 21 and 22 subordinates, were compared to assess their performance. 
										This group was chosen because it allowed for meaningful comparisons among a sizable number of managers (33%) 
										while minimizing the effects of over-representation from managers with fewer subordinates.

											<h4>Observation: High Performing Manager</h4>
											<p>
												<b>Brannon Miller had the highest rate of high-performing employees </b>, with 32% exceeding expectations. 
												In contrast, the other managers had rates ranging from 5% to 14%. 																									
											</p>
											<p>
												This could suggest that there may be differences in his management approach that contribute to this outcome. 
												Further investigation could explore these differences and identify best practices that could be shared with other managers.

											<h4>Observation: Manager Effect Differ by Subordniate Position</h4>
											<p>
												<b>Production technician II, when managed by Elijiah and Ketsia</b>, 
												tended to have higher rates of high performers than production technician I under their management. 
												In contrast, <b>Amy tended to have higher rates of high performers in production technician I</b> than in production technician II.
											</p>
											<p>											 
												These observations may be due to differences in expertise or other factors that require further investigation. 
												One potential solution could be to provide further training to improve managers' management skills in weaker-performing positions, 
												or to adjust subordinate composition to better match managers' strengths.

										<h3>Salary Equitability</h3>

											<h4>Observation: Inequitable Salary Among Production Technician I</h4>
											<p>
												A significant proportion of <b>Production Technician I employees are not receiving pay that matches their performance</b>. 
												Specifically, 31% of those who exceed expectations and 22% of those who fully meet expectations are being paid 10% less than the median,
												 while 54% of those who need improvement are being paid at least 5% more than the median. 
												This pay discrepancy may lead to job dissatisfaction among higher-performing employees.											
											</p>
											<p>
												Additionally, while higher pay does not necessarily correspond with better performance among Production Technician I employees,
												 this is not always the case in other positions, such as area sales manager and Production Technician II, 
												 where higher-performing employees tend to be paid more and vice versa.  
												This observation raises questions about <b>whether Product Technician I employees are motivated by pay</b>, 
												Further investigation is needed to identify the reasons behind the low performance of 
												higher-paid employees and to understand what motivates higher-performing employees who are being paid less.

										<h3>Termination Overview</h3>

									<p>A handful of positions were identified that are representative of the majority of our employees. 
										These positions cover the entire or nearly the entire spectrum of performance scores, allowing for meaningful comparisons.</p>

											<h4>Observation: Production Technicians II Are Quitting Due To Job Dissatisfaction</h4>
											<p>
												After analysing controllable terminations by position, 
												it was found that Production Technicians II had the highest rate of termination at <b>30%</b>, 
												when ignoring positions with less than 10 employees. 
												The data suggests that <b>many Production Technicians II find themselves not enjoying their job within the first two years</b>, 
												leading to subsequent quitting.											
											</p>
											<p>
												The primary reason for termination was being <b>unhappy</b>, followed by finding <b>another position</b> and working <b>hours</b>. 
												Production Technicians II were also more likely to <b>quit in the first to third year of employment</b>. 
												Another significant finding was that Amy Dunn's subordinates had a remarkably high termination rate due to controllable reasons, at 83%. 
												Further investigation is needed to determine the root cause of work dissatisfaction, 
												which may be related to compensation, working hours, or other factors.

											<h4>Observation: Production Technicians I Are Quitting Due To Lack Of Career Progression</h4>
											<p>
												Production Technicians I had the second  highest rate of termination at <b>22%</b>, 
												when ignoring positions with less than 10 employees.The data indicates that <b>between their third and fifth year,
												Production Technicians I are actively seeking jobs with better pay and other positions</b>, leading to quitting
										
											</p>
											<p>
												The primary reasons for termination among Production Technicians I were found to be finding <b>another position</b> and wanting <b>more money</b>. 
												Most Production Technicians I quit between their <b>third and fifth year of employment</b>. 
												This <b>could be due to a lack of career advancement opportunities or insufficient salary increments within the company</b>, 
												prompting Production Technicians I to explore opportunities elsewhere. 
												Conducting a study to better understand the career goals of these technicians and developing progression plans to retain them could be beneficial..
